* The app is free and does not require internet connection once it is downloaded from the App store.


![iPhone02_1290_2796](https://github.com/boyfriendnibluefairy/boyfriendnibluefairy.github.io/assets/30497886/ed63de32-5295-4964-b82d-775e8befca4d)

* When the app detects a cat, an alarm sound is automatically triggered.

* The user can adjust the volume of the alarm. To do this, click the "Adjust Alarm Volume" button on the home view.

* Clicking the "Adjust Alarm Button" will bring you to this view. Here, you can listen to the actual alarm sound while adjusting the volume. Click the play button begin listening.

* While the audio is playing, use the iPhone/iPad volume control buttons to fine tune the volume to your desired level. If you don't want your cat to notice your device, you might want to decrease the volume down to zero.

* Click "Start Cat Radar" to enable your device's video camera to detect a cat. Sorry, the app is originally named as Cat Dectector, but somebody already came up with this name so I have to rename it to Cat Radat

* To visually guide the user whether the app has successfully detected a cat, a red box will appear everytime the app recognizes a cat.


![iPhone09_1290_2796](https://github.com/boyfriendnibluefairy/boyfriendnibluefairy.github.io/assets/30497886/7cc723f6-51c4-46e0-9cdf-fd2bddd1d844)

* The app dynamically updates the positioning of the red box when the subject moves. This happens at a very fast rate to the point that the alarm sound is often cut off.


![iPhone10_1290_2796](https://github.com/boyfriendnibluefairy/boyfriendnibluefairy.github.io/assets/30497886/b61cba5f-8456-439a-8ebc-b51d59f7b517)

* Finally, even if the camera is active, you can adjust the volume of the alarm by using the iPhone/iPad built-in volume control buttons.

Enjoy using the app :)
